# File Manager UI

### `Work In Progress`

# TODO

- [ ] When some file moved to trash and then its folder moved to trash, then
  folder was deleted from trash can, we must show error when first file was
  tried to put back from trash (Folder is not exists).
    - [ ] We must have some action to do with this kind of file: move to folder.
- [ ] After paste or move node: trashed = false always

# For future

- [ ] Video poster generation
- [ ] Some videos with identical format have different encoders and one can be
  played in browser, some not. What to do with it?
